# PRG32 Framework Manual

PRG32 lets students write game logic in RISC-V assembly or C while a small
framework provides hardware access.

## Assembly ABI

Arguments use the standard RISC-V calling convention: `a0` to `a7` carry
arguments and return values, `ra` holds the return address, and `sp` is kept
16-byte aligned around C calls.

## Console modes

- `PRG32_MODE_UART_ONLY`: serial terminal only.
- `PRG32_MODE_LCD_ONLY`: text appears on the ILI9341 display.
- `PRG32_MODE_UART_LCD_MIRROR`: debug text is sent both to serial and LCD.

## Input

`prg32_input_read()` returns the PRG32 input register. The low bits are the
single local joystick:

- `PRG32_BTN_LEFT`
- `PRG32_BTN_RIGHT`
- `PRG32_BTN_UP`
- `PRG32_BTN_DOWN`
- `PRG32_BTN_A`
- `PRG32_BTN_B`
- `PRG32_BTN_SELECT` (`PRG32_BTN_START` is kept as an alias)

Games can use `prg32_input_read_player(1)` to get the same normalized low-bit
mask. `prg32_input_read_player(2)` is kept as a source-compatible helper, but
returns `0`; multiplayer games should use the PRG32 multiplayer API for remote
players.

QEMU and host-driven tests can inject the same bitmask through
`prg32_diag_set_input_state()`.

Menu/setup helpers call `prg32_input_read_menu()` to read the local joystick in
the same normalized low-bit mask.

System hotkey:

- A + B + DOWN on the local joystick: restart the ESP32-C6 firmware from
  anywhere in the PRG32 input path.

## Joystick Text Input

The on-screen keyboard lets games and framework setup screens collect short
alphanumeric text without a USB keyboard.

Useful calls:

- `prg32_keyboard_init(keyboard, buffer, capacity)`
- `prg32_keyboard_update(keyboard, input_mask)`
- `prg32_keyboard_draw(keyboard, x, y)`
- `prg32_text_input(buffer, capacity, title)`

Controls:

- D-pad: move around the key grid.
- SELECT: select the highlighted on-screen key.
- A: escape back to the previous state.
- B: confirm, equivalent to selecting the on-screen `return` key.

The keyboard uses a QWERTY layout with explicit `delete`, `shift`, and `return`
keys. `shift` toggles between lower-case and upper-case/symbol labels. The
`ascii` key opens a printable ASCII page covering characters 0x20 through 0x7e.
The LCD and QEMU text renderers include distinct glyphs for the full printable
ASCII range; console output also treats tab and DEL/backspace as text controls.

## Graphics model

The physical display is 320x240, while the normal game viewport remains
320x200. The firmware splash, setup, Wi-Fi setup, developer menu, and about
screen use the full display. Game and feature-demo drawing calls use the
centered 320x200 viewport so cartridges keep the same coordinate system and
the retro frame. Unless a program sets a band color explicitly, the upper and
lower horizontal bands are filled with the same color passed to
`prg32_gfx_clear`.

The QEMU renderer exposes the same 320x240 physical screen and centers the
320x200 PRG32 game viewport inside it. Student assembly code does not change;
only the selected display backend changes.

For classroom debugging, optional helper `prg32_debug_overlay_draw` can print
`x`, `y`, input mask, frame, and tick info on the top scanline.

Display backend selection:

- `CONFIG_PRG32_DISPLAY_ILI9341`: physical ILI9341 SPI TFT, default.
- `CONFIG_PRG32_DISPLAY_QEMU_RGB`: QEMU virtual RGB framebuffer.

Use the QEMU defaults file when running on a desktop:

```bash
idf.py -B build-qemu -D SDKCONFIG=build-qemu/sdkconfig -D SDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS=sdkconfig.defaults.qemu qemu --graphics monitor
```

When the QEMU backend is selected, `main/prg32_config.h` disables physical GPIO
buttons and the buzzer. QEMU builds keep player 1 usable through the UART
console keyboard mapper: arrows or `W`/`A`/`S`/`D` for the joystick,
`Enter`/`Space` for SELECT, `J`/`Z` for A, and `K`/`X` for B.

## Splash Screens

The resident firmware shows the PRG32 logo image after display initialization.
It can be disabled or timed through Kconfig:

- `CONFIG_PRG32_SPLASH_ENABLED`
- `CONFIG_PRG32_SPLASH_DURATION_MS`
- `CONFIG_PRG32_SPLASH_SOUND_ENABLED`

When splash sound is enabled, firmware plays a short welcome phrase through the
I2S audio subsystem only when the configured audio pins do not conflict with the
reference display/input wiring. Otherwise it uses the passive buzzer when one
is configured.

Graphic games can reuse the 320x200 game splash helpers:

- `prg32_splash_show_game(title, subtitle, duration_ms, bg, fg, accent)`:
  draw a game title screen, present it, and wait.
- `prg32_splash_draw_game(title, subtitle, bg, fg, accent)`: draw a game title
  screen without delaying, useful inside a title-state loop.

Framework-owned full-screen splash helpers remain available:

- `prg32_splash_show(title, subtitle, duration_ms, bg, fg, accent)`: draw,
  present, and wait on the full 320x240 display.
- `prg32_splash_draw(title, subtitle, bg, fg, accent)`: draw a splash/title
  screen without delaying on the full 320x240 display.
- `prg32_splash_show_default()`: show the firmware-style PRG32 splash.
- `prg32_gfx_set_fullscreen(enabled)`: switch between full-screen framework
  drawing and the centered game viewport.
- `prg32_gfx_set_band_color(color)`: set a custom color for the game viewport
  bands.
- `prg32_gfx_use_background_bands()`: return to automatic background-colored
  bands.
- `prg32_gfx_lock()` / `prg32_gfx_unlock()`: optional recursive graphics lock
  for advanced code that must update several draw calls atomically.
- `prg32_gfx_snapshot_row_rgb565(y, out, pixels)`: copy one physical 320-pixel
  framebuffer row as normal RGB565. The HTTP screenshot API uses this helper for
  both ILI9341 hardware and QEMU.

Assembly programs pass C strings in `a0` and `a1`, duration in `a2`, and RGB565
colors in `a3` to `a5`.

## Status Bands

When the viewport is active, PRG32 owns the 20-pixel band above the game and
the 20-pixel band below it. By default they follow the game background color.
Games can opt in to status text without changing the 320x200 play area:

- `prg32_band_set_mode(PRG32_BAND_TOP, mode)`
- `prg32_band_set_mode(PRG32_BAND_BOTTOM, mode)`
- `prg32_band_set_text(band, text)`
- `prg32_band_set_game_info(text)`
- `prg32_band_log(message)`
- `prg32_band_set_colors(band, fg, bg)`
- `prg32_band_use_default_colors(band)`

Available modes are `PRG32_BAND_MODE_NONE`, `PRG32_BAND_MODE_FPS`,
`PRG32_BAND_MODE_WIFI`, `PRG32_BAND_MODE_GAME`,
`PRG32_BAND_MODE_DEBUG`, and `PRG32_BAND_MODE_CUSTOM`. The setup developer
menu lets a trainer choose what appears in the top and bottom bands and stores
that choice in NVS.

## Screenshot API

When the resident HTTP server is reachable, `GET /api/screenshot.bmp` streams
the current full 320x240 framebuffer as a 24-bit BMP. It is intended for lab
reports, debugging display output, and comparing hardware with QEMU rendering:

```bash
curl http://192.168.4.1/api/screenshot.bmp --output screenshot.bmp
```

The encoder holds the recursive graphics lock while it streams rows. This keeps
the BMP internally consistent without allocating a complete second framebuffer
in ESP32 RAM.

## Performance Metrics

Optional performance metrics record update, draw, present, heap, input, FPS, and
deadline information while a cartridge is running. The feature is disabled by
default and controlled through Kconfig:

- `CONFIG_PRG32_METRICS_ENABLE`
- `CONFIG_PRG32_METRICS_SERVER_URL`
- `CONFIG_PRG32_METRICS_BOARD_ID`
- `CONFIG_PRG32_METRICS_SAMPLE_PERIOD_FRAMES`
- `CONFIG_PRG32_METRICS_UPLOAD_PERIOD_MS`
- `CONFIG_PRG32_METRICS_QUEUE_LEN`

The public API is in `prg32_metrics.h`:

- `prg32_metrics_init(config)`
- `prg32_metrics_start_run()`
- `prg32_metrics_stop_run()`
- `prg32_metrics_is_enabled()`
- `prg32_metrics_record(sample)`
- `prg32_metrics_run_id()`

The resident firmware instruments the cartridge update/draw/present loop when
metrics are enabled. `prg32_metrics_record` only copies into a ring buffer; HTTP
upload is handled asynchronously so the measured frame code does not wait for
the network. See `docs/metrics_api.md` for the server, export workflow, and lab
exercise.

Setup mode also includes `PERFORMANCE TEST`, an unattended multi-screen
benchmark that stores raw frame samples, one-second aggregate windows, and
per-screen summaries in RAM without streaming every frame. The latest run is
available as `/api/performance.json` until the next benchmark or reboot. The
built-in screens isolate clear/fill, text overlay, sprite storm, scrolling, and
mixed-gameplay workloads. Use `tools/prg32_metrics_paper.py` to turn that JSON
into LaTeX tables, captions, and high-resolution figures for a paper.

## Cartridge runtime

The resident firmware includes a cartridge loader so games can be replaced
without reflashing the whole ESP32-C6 app.

Important constants:

- `PRG32_CART_MAGIC`: `.prg32` package magic.
- `PRG32_CART_ABI_MAJOR` / `PRG32_CART_ABI_MINOR`: loader ABI version.
- `PRG32_CART_META_MAGIC`: optional metadata trailer magic, `PRG32META`.
- `PRG32_CART_META_ABI`: metadata JSON ABI, `prg32-metadata-1.0`.
- `PRG32_CART_COLOPHON_ABI`: colophon JSON ABI, `prg32-colophon-1.0`.
- `PRG32_CART_MAX_SIZE`: maximum `.prg32` package size, currently 32 KiB.
- `PRG32_CART_RAM_SIZE`: executable cartridge RAM window, currently 64 KiB.
- `PRG32_CART_SLOT_COUNT`: number of persistent flash cartridge slots.

Important functions:

- `prg32_cart_load_addr()`: runtime address used by the host linker.
- `prg32_cart_install(image, size, persist)`: validate, load, and optionally store.
- `prg32_cart_store_slot(slot, image, size)`: validate and store an image without running it.
- `prg32_cart_install_slot(slot, image, size, persist)`: install to `cart0` or `cart1`.
- `prg32_cart_select_slot(slot)`: load a stored cartridge from one slot.
- `prg32_cart_default_slot()`: read the saved default boot cartridge.
- `prg32_cart_set_default_slot(slot)`: save a default slot, or pass `-1` to clear it.
- `prg32_cart_select_default()`: load the saved default slot.
- `prg32_cart_stored_count()`: count valid stored cartridges.
- `prg32_cart_get_slot_info(slot, info)`: inspect one persistent slot.
- `prg32_cart_call_init()`
- `prg32_cart_call_update()`
- `prg32_cart_call_draw()`

The default app automatically calls the current cartridge every frame when one
is loaded. Store-ready cartridges may include a metadata trailer after the
legacy executable payload. The game colophon is shown after the cartridge is
activated, before the player starts a new play. See
[cartridge_metadata.md](cartridge_metadata.md),
[colophon_abi.md](colophon_abi.md), and
[setup_mode_cartridge_store.md](setup_mode_cartridge_store.md).

## Wi-Fi Modes and Setup

PRG32 supports three Wi-Fi runtime modes:

- `PRG32_WIFI_MODE_STA`: connect to an existing access point.
- `PRG32_WIFI_MODE_AP`: create the PRG32 access point.
- `PRG32_WIFI_MODE_APSTA`: keep the upload AP while also connecting as station.

After the startup splash, the resident ESP32-C6 firmware enters setup mode when
A and B are held during boot, whenever no stored cartridge is available, or
when multiple cartridges are available but no default cartridge has been saved.
If one cartridge is available, it starts automatically. If a default cartridge
has been saved, that cartridge starts automatically even when multiple slots are
filled.

The setup main menu contains cartridge launch, default cartridge selection,
Wi-Fi setup, Cartridge Store configuration and browsing, audio setup, the
developer band menu, the performance test, the about screen, and exit. The Cartridge Store integration
contract adds manual/discovered store URL entry, browsing, colophon preview, and
download-to-slot behavior for future firmware work. Use UP/DOWN to choose,
SELECT or B to confirm, and A to cancel/back. The
device smoke test is now the external
[DeviceDemo cartridge](https://github.com/riscv-prg32/DeviceDemo), which
exercises display, input, audio, sprites, scrolling, playfield rendering,
status bands, and small classroom sketches through the same cartridge ABI used
by student games.

The Wi-Fi setup screen lets the user choose access-point mode or infrastructure
mode. Infrastructure mode scans for nearby SSIDs, lists them on screen, and
uses UP/DOWN plus SELECT or B to select. A cancels back. The setup UI also
shows the active Wi-Fi mode and IP address; AP mode shows the AP SSID, while
infrastructure mode shows the selected/connected SSID.

`PRG32_BOOT_SETUP_MODE` in `main/prg32_config.h` can still force setup on every
boot for custom classroom images. If `PRG32_PIN_SETUP` is wired, holding it low
during boot also forces setup mode.

Useful calls:

- `prg32_wifi_setup_requested()`
- `prg32_wifi_setup_run()`
- `prg32_wifi_start_mode(config)`
- `prg32_wifi_current_mode()`
- `prg32_wifi_current_ip()`
- `prg32_wifi_current_ssid()`

The chosen settings are stored in NVS under the `prg32wifi` namespace. QEMU
builds keep physical Wi-Fi disabled by default, but games can still compile
against the same API and exercise setup screens.

## Multiplayer

PRG32 multiplayer is a cartridge-level state-sharing service. A cartridge opts
in by calling `prg32_multiplayer_join(signature, flags)` from its own code, or
by being packaged with `python3 -m prg32 build --multiplayer`. Use short
ASCII signatures such as `pong-v1` or `mygame:lab`. Players only see peers that
joined the same cartridge signature, so different games or different cartridge
revisions do not share a playfield.

The ESP32-C6 transport uses Wi-Fi station mode and WebSocket over TCP:

- ESP32-C6 has native Wi-Fi, so station mode is the right physical network
  transport for a classroom LAN.
- WebSocket keeps one persistent bidirectional connection, which is lower
  latency and simpler than repeated HTTP polling.
- The classroom server is Node.js with the `ws` package, which is small enough
  to run on an instructor laptop.

Useful calls:

- `prg32_multiplayer_init()`
- `prg32_multiplayer_available()`
- `prg32_multiplayer_join(signature, flags)`
- `prg32_multiplayer_leave()`
- `prg32_multiplayer_tick()`
- `prg32_multiplayer_set_local_state(x, y, sprite, flags)`
- `prg32_multiplayer_set_input(input)`
- `prg32_multiplayer_get_peer_count()`
- `prg32_multiplayer_get_peer(index, out)`

Run the standalone relay server from
[riscv-prg32/MultiplayerServer](https://github.com/riscv-prg32/MultiplayerServer):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/riscv-prg32/MultiplayerServer.git
cd MultiplayerServer
npm install
npm start
```

Configure the board-side endpoint in `main/prg32_config.h` with
`PRG32_MULTIPLAYER_SERVER_URL`. QEMU exposes the same API with an offline local
stub: `prg32_multiplayer_available()` returns true, `join` succeeds for a
non-empty signature, and peer snapshots are empty by default.

## Tile engine

The tile engine exposes a 40x25 grid of 8x8 tiles. This matches a 320x200 retro
screen exactly.

Useful calls:

- `prg32_tile_define(id, bitmap8x8, fg, bg)`: define a reusable tile.
- `prg32_tile_put(tx, ty, id)`: place a tile in the simple 40x25 tile map.
- `prg32_tile_present()`: draw dirty simple-map tiles and present the frame.

The simple tile map is best for first tile exercises. Use playfields when the
lesson needs scrolling, parallax, or two layers.

## Scrolling and Playfields

PRG32 includes two scrollable 64x32 tile playfields. A playfield is larger than
the visible 40x25 tile viewport, so it can scroll horizontally and vertically.

Useful calls:

- `prg32_playfield_clear(layer, tile_id)`: fill one playfield with a tile.
- `prg32_playfield_put(layer, tx, ty, id)`: place a tile in one playfield.
- `prg32_playfield_scroll(layer, x, y)`: set pixel scroll for one layer.
- `prg32_playfield_scroll_by(layer, dx, dy)`: move one layer by a delta.
- `prg32_playfield_camera(x, y)`: set a shared camera position.
- `prg32_playfield_parallax(layer, x_q8, y_q8)`: set camera scale per layer.
- `prg32_playfield_draw(layer, transparent_zero)`: draw one layer.
- `prg32_playfield_draw_dual()`: draw layer 0 opaque and layer 1 transparent.

Parallax factors use Q8 fixed point:

```text
256 = 1.0x camera speed
128 = 0.5x camera speed
 64 = 0.25x camera speed
```

For a parallax background, set layer 0 to a smaller factor and layer 1 to
`PRG32_PARALLAX_1X`. The foreground layer treats tile `0` as transparent when
drawn through `prg32_playfield_draw_dual()`.

## Platform Tile Engine

The platform helpers build on playfields by assigning behavior flags to tile
IDs and moving an actor rectangle through the flagged world.

Tile flags:

- `PRG32_TILE_FLAG_SOLID`: blocks movement from every side.
- `PRG32_TILE_FLAG_PLATFORM`: one-way floor, useful for ledges.
- `PRG32_TILE_FLAG_HAZARD`: marks spikes, enemies, or damage tiles.
- `PRG32_TILE_FLAG_COLLECT`: marks collectible tiles.

Actor state bits:

- `PRG32_PLATFORM_ON_GROUND`
- `PRG32_PLATFORM_HIT_LEFT`
- `PRG32_PLATFORM_HIT_RIGHT`
- `PRG32_PLATFORM_HIT_HEAD`
- `PRG32_PLATFORM_HAZARD`
- `PRG32_PLATFORM_COLLECT`

Useful calls:

- `prg32_platform_tile_flags(tile_id, flags)`: define tile behavior.
- `prg32_platform_actor_init(actor, layer, x, y, w, h)`: create an actor.
- `prg32_platform_actor_step(actor, input, speed, jump, gravity, max_fall)`:
  apply left/right movement, jump, gravity, and tile collision.
- `prg32_platform_camera_follow(actor, deadzone_x, deadzone_y)`: follow an actor
  inside the playfield world.

The platform engine intentionally uses integer pixels and small rectangles so
students can inspect every value from C or RISC-V assembly.

Assembly labs can use the `PRG32_PLATFORM_ACTOR_*_OFFSET` macros or treat
`prg32_platform_actor_t` as a 24-byte record:

```text
0:x  4:y  8:vx  12:vy  16:w  18:h  20:state  22:layer
```

## Sprite engine

The sprite layer provides simple bitmap drawing and axis-aligned bounding-box
collision detection.

Useful calls:

- `prg32_sprite_draw_8x8(x, y, bits, fg, bg)`: draw a monochrome sprite.
- `prg32_sprite_draw_16x16(x, y, rgb565)`: draw a 16x16 RGB565 sprite.
- `prg32_sprite_hitbox(...)`: test two axis-aligned rectangles.
- `prg32_sprite_anim_frame(now_ms, frame_count, frame_ms)`: compute a frame.
- `prg32_sprite_draw_frame(...)`: draw one frame from a sprite sheet.

`prg32_sprite_draw_frame` accepts width, height, a pointer to contiguous RGB565
frames, the frame index, and a transparent color. This keeps animated sprites
usable from assembly without requiring a C object.

## Audio

PRG32 has two audio layers.

The legacy teaching helpers still use PWM to drive a passive buzzer:

- `prg32_audio_beep(hz, ms)`
- `prg32_audio_tone(hz, ms, duty)`: PWM tone with explicit duty cycle.
- `prg32_audio_note(midi_note, ms)`: MIDI-like note number to tone.
- `prg32_audio_play_notes(notes, count)`: blocking sequence of notes/rests.
- `prg32_audio_sample_u8(samples, count, rate)`: play unsigned 8-bit samples
  through PWM.

The I2S audio runtime lives in the `prg32_audio` component and targets
MAX98357A DAC/amplifier boards:

- mono mode: one MAX98357A, default, 22050 Hz, 6 voices
- stereo mode: two MAX98357A boards, optional PRG32 Audio Plus, panned voices

Useful calls:

- `prg32_audio_init(config)`: start the I2S mixer runtime.
- `prg32_audio_get_mode()`: return mono or stereo.
- `prg32_audio_register_sample(...)`: register unsigned 8-bit PCM.
- `prg32_audio_play_sample(sample_id, volume, pitch)`: trigger a sample.
- `prg32_audio_play_sample_pan(sample_id, volume, pitch, pan)`: trigger with pan.
- `prg32_audio_note_on(channel, instrument, note, volume)`: start a pitched note.
- `prg32_audio_play_track(track_id)`: start tracker event playback.

Pitch `1024` means natural sample speed. Volumes use `0..255`. Pan uses
`-64..+63`; mono mode accepts pan calls but outputs mono.

See `docs/audio.md` for wiring, examples, and the cartridge AUDIO block format.

The setup audio menu auto-detects the active output path:

- none
- PWM buzzer
- mono I2S
- stereo I2S

It lets trainers set the test volume, play a short tune, and toggle the
onboard RGB LED as a spectrum-style VU meter when the LED GPIO is available.

## Onboard RGB LED

PRG32 exposes a small addressable RGB LED API:

- `prg32_rgb_led_init(gpio)`: initialize the board LED on a free GPIO.
- `prg32_rgb_led_available()`: return whether the LED is ready.
- `prg32_rgb_led_set(red, green, blue)`: set 8-bit RGB intensity.
- `prg32_rgb_led_off()`: turn the LED off.
- `prg32_rgb_led_vu(level)`: map a 0-255 level to a blue/green/yellow/red
  spectrum color.
- `prg32_audio_led_vu_enable(enabled)`: let the audio test and PWM helpers
  drive the LED as a VU meter.

The reference ILI9341 wiring uses GPIO8 for LCD D/C. Many ESP32-C6 development
boards also use GPIO8 for the onboard RGB LED, so `PRG32_PIN_RGB_LED` defaults
to `-1` in `main/prg32_config.h`. Set it only when the LED pin is free on the
chosen board wiring.
