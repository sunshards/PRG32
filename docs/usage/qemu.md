# PRG32 QEMU Screen Emulator

PRG32 can run on a desktop with Espressif QEMU and show the 320x240 PRG32 screen in a virtual RGB framebuffer window. This is intended for students who want to compile and test graphics before flashing real ESP32-C6 hardware.

## Architecture Overview

While the physical PRG32 board uses an ESP32-C6 target with an ILI9341 SPI display, the QEMU emulator targets the **ESP32-C3** using a virtual RGB display backend (`CONFIG_PRG32_DISPLAY_QEMU_RGB`). This is because Espressif's maintained RISC-V QEMU graphics path requires the ESP32-C3.

- **Separate Build Environment**: QEMU uses a separate build directory (`build-qemu`) and defaults file (`sdkconfig.defaults.qemu`) to ensure physical board configurations remain untouched.
- **Unified ABI**: Both physical and QEMU targets share the same 32-bit RISC-V calling convention and PRG32 ABI. Only the display backend changes.
- **Screen Resolution**: Framework screens use the full 320x240 resolution, while game code draws into a centered 320x200 viewport.

## How It Works

- **Display Backends**: `components/prg32/Kconfig` switches between the physical ILI9341 SPI TFT (`CONFIG_PRG32_DISPLAY_ILI9341`) and the Espressif QEMU virtual RGB panel (`CONFIG_PRG32_DISPLAY_QEMU_RGB`).
- **Dependencies**: The `components/prg32/idf_component.yml` manifest pulls the `espressif/esp_lcd_qemu_rgb` component exclusively when the target is ESP32-C3.
- **Screenshots**: The QEMU backend exposes the same framebuffer snapshot API, meaning the `/api/screenshot.bmp` endpoint generates identical 320x240 BMPs as the real hardware.

## Prerequisites and Installation

### Supported Hosts
Espressif provides QEMU RISC-V packages for: macOS (Intel/Apple Silicon), Windows (x64), and Linux (x86_64, arm64).

### 1. Install ESP-IDF and QEMU
Read the Install & Setup section in the main [README](/README.md).

## Running QEMU

There are several ways to run the QEMU emulator, depending on your preferred workflow.

### Option A: Python Tooling (Recommended)

The unified Python tooling is the easiest way to build and launch QEMU on any platform:

```bash
python3 -m prg32 qemu build-and-run
```

### Option B: VS Code Tasks

If you are using the provided `PRG32.code-workspace`, run these tasks via the command palette:
1. `PRG32: qemu set target esp32c3`
2. `PRG32: qemu build`
3. `PRG32: qemu screen`

For debugger exercises, use two terminals:
1. Run `PRG32: qemu debug server`.
2. Run `PRG32: qemu gdb`.

## Using Cartridges in QEMU

QEMU uses the same `.prg32` game packages as the physical board.

1. **Build the QEMU Emulator** (if not already built):
   ```bash
   python3 -m prg32 qemu build
   ```
2. **Prepare a Cartridge**: Build a `.prg32` cartridge for QEMU. See [../software/cartridges.md](/docs/software/cartridges.md) for details.
3. **Upload the Cartridge**: Stage it into the emulator's flash image.
   ```bash
   python3 -m prg32 qemu upload build-qemu/asteroids.prg32
   ```
4. **Run QEMU**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m prg32 qemu run
   ```
   *(Note: You can also use `python3 -m prg32 qemu build-and-run` for convenience).*

## QEMU Audio (UART Redirection)

Because QEMU lacks native I2S emulation for the ESP32-C3 backend, PRG32 uses a custom **Credit-Based Flow Control** protocol to redirect the 22050Hz PCM audio stream over the virtual UART port (`tcp::4321`) to the host machine.

### Architecture Details

- **Background Player**: `launch_qemu.py` automatically spawns `tools/qemu_audio_player.py` in the background to interface with PyAudio on the host. It includes a process polling loop to gracefully terminate QEMU if the audio player fails to start.
- **Real-Time Pacing (Credit-Based Flow Control)**: QEMU instantly fast-forwards virtual time when the CPU is idle. To prevent audio from generating faster than the host can play it, the firmware's `audio_task` blocks on `uart_read_bytes` after sending each 20ms audio chunk. The Python script plays the audio natively (taking exactly 20ms) and sends a 1-byte `ACK` token back. This turns the host's physical audio hardware clock into the pacing mechanism for the entire QEMU virtual machine, guaranteeing flawless 1.0x real-time synchronization.
- **Network Optimizations**: Sending 1-byte ACKs and 882-byte audio chunks frequently triggers Nagle's Algorithm on modern OS network stacks, causing artificial 200ms batching delays. The `nodelay` flag is applied to QEMU's `-serial` arguments and `socket.TCP_NODELAY` is used in the Python listener to ensure instant transmission and zero network-induced stutter.
- **Linux ALSA/PulseAudio Compatibility**: The PyAudio stream uses a 10-credit (200ms) jitter buffer and pipelined credit generation to prevent PulseAudio from starving during OS scheduling spikes, resolving pitch-shifting and distortion on Linux backends. Furthermore, `OSError` underflow exceptions are caught and suppressed to prevent random crashes on Linux, ensuring QEMU is never starved of flow-control credits.

## Input and Controls

QEMU disables physical GPIO buttons and the buzzer, enabling a small UART-console keyboard mapper for player 1 input instead. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Because input is read from the UART console, you must ensure your **terminal window** running QEMU is the active window to use the keyboard, *not* the graphical QEMU screen itself.

| PRG32 Input | QEMU Key(s) |
| --- | --- |
| D-Pad (Up, Down, Left, Right) | Arrow keys or `W`, `S`, `A`, `D` |
| SELECT | `Enter` or `Space` |
| A button | `J` or `Z` |
| B button | `K`, `X`, `Backspace`, or `Esc` |

**Diagnostic Input Injection**:
Framework code can call `prg32_diag_set_input_state()` to inject player-1 inputs in QEMU-oriented tests. 

**Multiplayer API**:
The multiplayer API works in QEMU without actual Wi-Fi. Calling `prg32_multiplayer_join()` succeeds locally, `prg32_multiplayer_available()` returns true, and peer snapshots default to empty.

## Recording cartridge previews

`tools/capture_cartridge_previews.py` creates the checked-in 30-second MP4s
from actual cartridge execution. On macOS it continuously records the QEMU SDL window,
crops away the window chrome and firmware status bands to retain only the
320×200 game playfield, records the real 22050 Hz UART PCM stream, and injects
documented gameplay controls through the QEMU UART keyboard mapper.

```bash
source "$HOME/esp-idf/export.sh"
python3 -m prg32 qemu build
python3 tools/capture_cartridge_previews.py
```

The script requires macOS `screencapture`, Swift/CoreGraphics, and FFmpeg
(either `imageio-ffmpeg` or an explicit `--ffmpeg PATH`). The native window
recorder avoids per-frame screenshot processes, leaving QEMU enough CPU to
advance animation and its credit-paced audio clock in real time. If screen
recording delays that clock by more than 250 ms, the tool deterministically
replays the same cartridge and input sequence with SDL active but without the
screen recorder, then uses that complete real PCM stream. It never substitutes
or time-stretches generated audio.
