# PRG32 Framework Manual

> [!NOTE]
> This manual is intended for **users and students** writing cartridges using the provided API. It is **not** intended for developers modifying the underlying ESP-IDF C framework.

PRG32 lets students write game logic in RISC-V assembly or C while a small
framework provides hardware access.

## Assembly ABI

Arguments use the standard RISC-V calling convention: `a0` to `a7` carry
arguments and return values, `ra` holds the return address, and `sp` is kept
16-byte aligned around C calls.

## Console modes

- `PRG32_MODE_UART_ONLY`: serial terminal only.
- `PRG32_MODE_LCD_ONLY`: text appears on the ILI9341 display.
- `PRG32_MODE_UART_LCD_MIRROR`: debug text is sent both to serial and LCD.

## Input

`prg32_input_read()` returns the PRG32 input register. The low bits are the
single local joystick:

- `PRG32_BTN_LEFT`
- `PRG32_BTN_RIGHT`
- `PRG32_BTN_UP`
- `PRG32_BTN_DOWN`
- `PRG32_BTN_A`
- `PRG32_BTN_B`
- `PRG32_BTN_SELECT` (`PRG32_BTN_START` is kept as an alias)

Games can use `prg32_input_read_player(1)` to get the same normalized low-bit
mask. `prg32_input_read_player(2)` is kept as a source-compatible helper, but
returns `0`; multiplayer games should use the PRG32 multiplayer API for remote
players.

QEMU and host-driven tests can inject the same bitmask through
`prg32_diag_set_input_state()`.

Menu/setup helpers call `prg32_input_read_menu()` to read the local joystick in
the same normalized low-bit mask.

System hotkey:

- A + B + DOWN on the local joystick: restart the ESP32-C6 firmware from
  anywhere in the PRG32 input path.

## Joystick Text Input

The on-screen keyboard lets games and framework setup screens collect short
alphanumeric text without a USB keyboard.

Useful calls:

- `prg32_keyboard_init(keyboard, buffer, capacity)`
- `prg32_keyboard_update(keyboard, input_mask)`
- `prg32_keyboard_draw(keyboard, x, y)`
- `prg32_text_input(buffer, capacity, title)`

Controls:

- D-pad: move around the key grid.
- SELECT: select the highlighted on-screen key.
- A: escape back to the previous state.
- B: confirm, equivalent to selecting the on-screen `return` key.

The keyboard uses a QWERTY layout with explicit `delete`, `shift`, and `return`
keys. `shift` toggles between lower-case and upper-case/symbol labels. The
`ascii` key opens a printable ASCII page covering characters 0x20 through 0x7e.
The LCD and QEMU text renderers include distinct glyphs for the full printable
ASCII range; console output also treats tab and DEL/backspace as text controls.

## Graphics model

The physical display is 320x240, while the normal game viewport remains
320x200. The firmware splash, setup, Wi-Fi setup, developer menu, and about
screen use the full display. Game and feature-demo drawing calls use the
centered 320x200 viewport so cartridges keep the same coordinate system and
the retro frame. Unless a program sets a band color explicitly, the upper and
lower horizontal bands are filled with the same color passed to
`prg32_gfx_clear`.

The QEMU renderer exposes the same 320x240 physical screen and centers the
320x200 PRG32 game viewport inside it. Student assembly code does not change;
only the selected display backend changes.

For classroom debugging, optional helper `prg32_debug_overlay_draw` can print
`x`, `y`, input mask, frame, and tick info on the top scanline.

Display backend selection:

- `CONFIG_PRG32_DISPLAY_ILI9341`: physical ILI9341 SPI TFT, default.
- `CONFIG_PRG32_DISPLAY_QEMU_RGB`: QEMU virtual RGB framebuffer.

Use the QEMU defaults file when running on a desktop:

```bash
idf.py -B build-qemu -D SDKCONFIG=build-qemu/sdkconfig -D SDKCONFIG_DEFAULTS=sdkconfig.defaults.qemu qemu --graphics monitor
```

When the QEMU backend is selected, `main/prg32_config.h` disables physical GPIO
buttons and the buzzer. QEMU builds keep player 1 usable through the UART
console keyboard mapper: arrows or `W`/`A`/`S`/`D` for the joystick,
`Enter`/`Space` for SELECT, `J`/`Z` for A, and `K`/`X` for B.

## Splash Screens

The resident firmware shows the PRG32 logo image after display initialization.
It can be disabled or timed through Kconfig:

- `CONFIG_PRG32_SPLASH_ENABLED`
- `CONFIG_PRG32_SPLASH_DURATION_MS`
- `CONFIG_PRG32_SPLASH_SOUND_ENABLED`

When splash sound is enabled, firmware plays a short welcome phrase through the
I2S audio subsystem only when the configured audio pins do not conflict with the
reference display/input wiring. Otherwise it uses the passive buzzer when one
is configured.

Graphic games can reuse the 320x200 game splash helpers:

- `prg32_splash_show_game(title, subtitle, duration_ms, bg, fg, accent)`:
  draw a game title screen, present it, and wait.
- `prg32_splash_draw_game(title, subtitle, bg, fg, accent)`: draw a game title
  screen without delaying, useful inside a title-state loop.

Framework-owned full-screen splash helpers remain available:

- `prg32_splash_show(title, subtitle, duration_ms, bg, fg, accent)`: draw,
  present, and wait on the full 320x240 display.
- `prg32_splash_draw(title, subtitle, bg, fg, accent)`: draw a splash/title
  screen without delaying on the full 320x240 display.
- `prg32_splash_show_default()`: show the firmware-style PRG32 splash.
- `prg32_gfx_set_fullscreen(enabled)`: switch between full-screen framework
  drawing and the centered game viewport.
- `prg32_gfx_set_band_color(color)`: set a custom color for the game viewport
  bands.
- `prg32_gfx_use_background_bands()`: return to automatic background-colored
  bands.
- `prg32_gfx_lock()` / `prg32_gfx_unlock()`: optional recursive graphics lock
  for advanced code that must update several draw calls atomically.
- `prg32_gfx_snapshot_row_rgb565(y, out, pixels)`: copy one physical 320-pixel
  framebuffer row as normal RGB565. The HTTP screenshot API uses this helper for
  both ILI9341 hardware and QEMU.

Assembly programs pass C strings in `a0` and `a1`, duration in `a2`, and RGB565
colors in `a3` to `a5`.

## Status Bands

When the viewport is active, PRG32 owns the 20-pixel band above the game and
the 20-pixel band below it. By default they follow the game background color.
Games can opt in to status text without changing the 320x200 play area:

- `prg32_band_set_mode(PRG32_BAND_TOP, mode)`
- `prg32_band_set_mode(PRG32_BAND_BOTTOM, mode)`
- `prg32_band_set_text(band, text)`
- `prg32_band_set_game_info(text)`
- `prg32_band_log(message)`
- `prg32_band_set_colors(band, fg, bg)`
- `prg32_band_use_default_colors(band)`

Available modes are `PRG32_BAND_MODE_NONE`, `PRG32_BAND_MODE_FPS`,
`PRG32_BAND_MODE_WIFI`, `PRG32_BAND_MODE_GAME`,
`PRG32_BAND_MODE_DEBUG`, and `PRG32_BAND_MODE_CUSTOM`. The setup developer
menu lets a trainer choose what appears in the top and bottom bands and stores
that choice in NVS.

## Screenshot API

When the resident HTTP server is reachable, `GET /api/screenshot.bmp` streams
the current full 320x240 framebuffer as a 24-bit BMP. It is intended for lab
reports, debugging display output, and comparing hardware with QEMU rendering:

```bash
curl http://192.168.4.1/api/screenshot.bmp --output screenshot.bmp
```

The encoder holds the recursive graphics lock while it streams rows. This keeps
the BMP internally consistent without allocating a complete second framebuffer
in ESP32 RAM.

## Performance Metrics

Optional performance metrics record update, draw, present, heap, input, FPS, and
deadline information while a cartridge is running. The feature is disabled by
default and controlled through Kconfig:

- `CONFIG_PRG32_METRICS_ENABLE`
- `CONFIG_PRG32_METRICS_SERVER_URL`
- `CONFIG_PRG32_METRICS_BOARD_ID`
- `CONFIG_PRG32_METRICS_SAMPLE_PERIOD_FRAMES`
- `CONFIG_PRG32_METRICS_UPLOAD_PERIOD_MS`
- `CONFIG_PRG32_METRICS_QUEUE_LEN`

The metrics upload queue is allocated only when a metrics run starts. Recording
remains non-blocking; if the queue fills, new samples are dropped and reported
with the next uploaded batch.

The public API is in `prg32_metrics.h`:

- `prg32_metrics_init(config)`
- `prg32_metrics_start_run()`
- `prg32_metrics_stop_run()`
- `prg32_metrics_is_enabled()`
- `prg32_metrics_record(sample)`
- `prg32_metrics_run_id()`

The resident firmware instruments the cartridge update/draw/present loop when
metrics are enabled. `prg32_metrics_record` only copies into a ring buffer; HTTP
upload is handled asynchronously so the measured frame code does not wait for
the network. See [Performance Metrics](/docs/measurement/metrics_api.md) for
the server, export workflow, and lab exercise.

The optional `performancetest` cartridge provides an unattended multi-case
benchmark that retains compact per-screen/per-color-mode summaries in RAM
without streaming every frame. Temporary percentile samples are released at
the end of each case. The latest run is
available as `/api/performance.json` until the next benchmark or reboot. The
cartridge cases isolate clear/fill, text overlay, sprite storm, scrolling, and
mixed-gameplay workloads. Every workload runs through matched RGB565 and
indexed-color sprite probes; the final screen reports an aggregate summary and
the complete result endpoint. The JSON API preserves the mode on every case
summary. See the [Performance Test Guide](/docs/performance_test.md) for the
execution workflow, interpretation rules, and custom ABI tutorial.

`screen_count` remains five because it counts distinct workloads;
`result_count` is ten because every workload produces an RGB565 result and an
indexed result. Both modes ultimately present RGB565 pixels, so the comparison
isolates compact-asset decoding rather than LCD wire-format bandwidth.

## Cartridge runtime

The resident firmware includes a cartridge loader so games can be replaced
without reflashing the whole ESP32-C6 app.

Important constants:

- `PRG32_CART_MAGIC`: `.prg32` package magic.
- `PRG32_CART_ABI_MAJOR` / `PRG32_CART_ABI_MINOR`: loader ABI version.
- `PRG32_CART_META_MAGIC`: optional metadata trailer magic, `PRG32META`.
- `PRG32_CART_META_ABI`: metadata JSON ABI, `prg32-metadata-1.0`.
- `PRG32_CART_COLOPHON_ABI`: colophon JSON ABI, `prg32-colophon-1.0`.
- `PRG32_CART_MAX_SIZE`: maximum `.prg32` package size, currently 128 KiB.
- `PRG32_CART_RAM_SIZE`: statically placed executable cartridge RAM window,
  configured by `CONFIG_PRG32_CART_RAM_PROFILE`. Physical ESP32-C6 classroom
  builds default to 32 KiB to preserve setup/Wi-Fi heap, while QEMU defaults to
  the 64 KiB extended profile for desktop experiments. The optional
  `PRG32_CART_RAM_LARGE_128` profile reserves 128 KiB on ESP32-C6 when built
  with `sdkconfig.defaults.esp32c6_128k`; it requires matching rebuilt
  cartridges. The window remains
  static because cartridges are linked to the exported `prg32_cart_exec`
  address.
- `PRG32_CART_SLOT_COUNT`: number of persistent flash cartridge slots.

Important functions:

- `prg32_cart_load_addr()`: runtime address used by the host linker.
- `prg32_cart_install(image, size, persist)`: validate, load, and optionally store.
- `prg32_cart_store_slot(slot, image, size)`: validate and store an image without running it.
- `prg32_cart_install_slot(slot, image, size, persist)`: install to one of
  `cart0` through `cart3`.
- `prg32_cart_select_slot(slot)`: load a stored cartridge from one slot.
- `prg32_cart_default_slot()`: read the saved default boot cartridge.
- `prg32_cart_set_default_slot(slot)`: save a default slot, or pass `-1` to clear it.
- `prg32_cart_select_default()`: load the saved default slot.
- `prg32_cart_stored_count()`: count valid stored cartridges.
- `prg32_cart_get_slot_info(slot, info)`: inspect one persistent slot.
- `prg32_cart_call_init()`
- `prg32_cart_call_update()`
- `prg32_cart_call_draw()`

The default app automatically calls the current cartridge every frame when one
is loaded. Store-ready cartridges may include a metadata trailer after the
legacy executable payload. The game colophon is shown after the cartridge is
activated, before the player starts a new play. See
[cartridge_metadata.md](/docs/cartridge_store/cartridge_store.md),
[colophon_abi.md](colophon_abi.md), and
[setup_mode_cartridge_store.md](/docs/cartridge_store/cartridge_store.md).

## Wi-Fi Modes and Setup

For a full guide on connecting the board to a network, see the [Network Setup and Wi-Fi Modes](/docs/usage/network.md) documentation. 

PRG32 supports three Wi-Fi runtime modes (`PRG32_WIFI_MODE_STA`, `PRG32_WIFI_MODE_AP`, `PRG32_WIFI_MODE_APSTA`).

After the startup splash, the resident ESP32-C6 firmware enters setup mode when
A and B are held during boot, whenever no stored cartridge is available, or
when multiple cartridges are available but no default cartridge has been saved.
If one cartridge is available, it starts automatically. If a default cartridge
has been saved, that cartridge starts automatically even when multiple slots are
filled.

The setup main menu contains cartridge launch, default cartridge selection,
Wi-Fi setup, Cartridge Store configuration and browsing, audio setup, the
developer band menu, the performance test, the about screen, and exit. The Cartridge Store integration
contract adds manual/discovered store URL entry, browsing, colophon preview, and
download-to-slot behavior for future firmware work. Use UP/DOWN to choose,
SELECT or A to confirm, and B to cancel/back. The
device smoke test is now the external
[DeviceDemo cartridge](https://github.com/riscv-prg32/DeviceDemo), which
exercises display, input, audio, sprites, scrolling, playfield rendering,
status bands, and small classroom sketches through the same cartridge ABI used
by student games.

Normal images autoload their only stored cartridge, or the saved default when
multiple cartridges are present. `PRG32_BOOT_SETUP_MODE` in
`main/prg32_config.h` can force setup on every boot for custom classroom
images. If `PRG32_PIN_SETUP` is wired, holding it low during boot also forces
setup mode.

Useful calls:

- `prg32_wifi_setup_requested()`
- `prg32_wifi_setup_run()`
- `prg32_wifi_start_mode(config)`
- `prg32_wifi_current_mode()`
- `prg32_wifi_current_ip()`
- `prg32_wifi_current_ssid()`

## Multiplayer

PRG32 multiplayer is a cartridge-level state-sharing service. A cartridge opts
in by calling `prg32_multiplayer_join(signature, flags)` from its own code, or
by being packaged with `python3 -m prg32 cartridge build --multiplayer`. Use short
ASCII signatures such as `pong-v1` or `mygame:lab`. Players only see peers that
joined the same cartridge signature, so different games or different cartridge
revisions do not share a playfield.

The ESP32-C6 transport uses Wi-Fi station mode and WebSocket over TCP:

- ESP32-C6 has native Wi-Fi, so station mode is the right physical network
  transport for a classroom LAN.
- WebSocket keeps one persistent bidirectional connection, which is lower
  latency and simpler than repeated HTTP polling.
- The classroom server is Node.js with the `ws` package, which is small enough
  to run on an instructor laptop.

Useful calls:

- `prg32_multiplayer_init()`
- `prg32_multiplayer_available()`
- `prg32_multiplayer_join(signature, flags)`
- `prg32_multiplayer_leave()`
- `prg32_multiplayer_tick()`
- `prg32_multiplayer_set_local_state(x, y, sprite, flags)`
- `prg32_multiplayer_set_input(input)`
- `prg32_multiplayer_get_peer_count()`
- `prg32_multiplayer_get_peer(index, out)`

Run the standalone relay server from
[riscv-prg32/MultiplayerServer](https://github.com/riscv-prg32/MultiplayerServer):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/riscv-prg32/MultiplayerServer.git
cd MultiplayerServer
npm install
npm start
```

Configure the board-side endpoint in `main/prg32_config.h` with
`PRG32_MULTIPLAYER_SERVER_URL`. QEMU exposes the same API with an offline local
stub: `prg32_multiplayer_available()` returns true, `join` succeeds for a
non-empty signature, and peer snapshots are empty by default.

## Tile engine

The tile engine exposes a 40x25 grid of 8x8 tiles. This matches a 320x200 retro
screen exactly.

Useful calls:

- `prg32_tile_define(id, bitmap8x8, fg, bg)`: define a reusable tile.
- `prg32_tile_put(tx, ty, id)`: place a tile in the simple 40x25 tile map.
- `prg32_tile_present()`: draw dirty simple-map tiles and present the frame.

The simple tile map is best for first tile exercises. Use playfields when the
lesson needs scrolling, parallax, or two layers.

## Scrolling and Playfields

PRG32 includes two scrollable 64x32 tile playfields. A playfield is larger than
the visible 40x25 tile viewport, so it can scroll horizontally and vertically.

Useful calls:

- `prg32_playfield_clear(layer, tile_id)`: fill one playfield with a tile.
- `prg32_playfield_put(layer, tx, ty, id)`: place a tile in one playfield.
- `prg32_playfield_scroll(layer, x, y)`: set pixel scroll for one layer.
- `prg32_playfield_scroll_by(layer, dx, dy)`: move one layer by a delta.
- `prg32_playfield_camera(x, y)`: set a shared camera position.
- `prg32_playfield_parallax(layer, x_q8, y_q8)`: set camera scale per layer.
- `prg32_playfield_draw(layer, transparent_zero)`: draw one layer.
- `prg32_playfield_draw_dual()`: draw layer 0 opaque and layer 1 transparent.

Parallax factors use Q8 fixed point:

```text
256 = 1.0x camera speed
128 = 0.5x camera speed
 64 = 0.25x camera speed
```

For a parallax background, set layer 0 to a smaller factor and layer 1 to
`PRG32_PARALLAX_1X`. The foreground layer treats tile `0` as transparent when
drawn through `prg32_playfield_draw_dual()`.

## Platform Tile Engine

The platform helpers build on playfields by assigning behavior flags to tile
IDs and moving an actor rectangle through the flagged world.

Tile flags:

- `PRG32_TILE_FLAG_SOLID`: blocks movement from every side.
- `PRG32_TILE_FLAG_PLATFORM`: one-way floor, useful for ledges.
- `PRG32_TILE_FLAG_HAZARD`: marks spikes, enemies, or damage tiles.
- `PRG32_TILE_FLAG_COLLECT`: marks collectible tiles.

Actor state bits:

- `PRG32_PLATFORM_ON_GROUND`
- `PRG32_PLATFORM_HIT_LEFT`
- `PRG32_PLATFORM_HIT_RIGHT`
- `PRG32_PLATFORM_HIT_HEAD`
- `PRG32_PLATFORM_HAZARD`
- `PRG32_PLATFORM_COLLECT`

Useful calls:

- `prg32_platform_tile_flags(tile_id, flags)`: define tile behavior.
- `prg32_platform_actor_init(actor, layer, x, y, w, h)`: create an actor.
- `prg32_platform_actor_step(actor, input, speed, jump, gravity, max_fall)`:
  apply left/right movement, jump, gravity, and tile collision.
- `prg32_platform_camera_follow(actor, deadzone_x, deadzone_y)`: follow an actor
  inside the playfield world.

The platform engine intentionally uses integer pixels and small rectangles so
students can inspect every value from C or RISC-V assembly.

Assembly labs can use the `PRG32_PLATFORM_ACTOR_*_OFFSET` macros or treat
`prg32_platform_actor_t` as a 24-byte record:

```text
0:x  4:y  8:vx  12:vy  16:w  18:h  20:state  22:layer
```

## Sprite engine

The sprite layer provides simple bitmap drawing and axis-aligned bounding-box
collision detection.

Useful calls:

- `prg32_sprite_draw_8x8(x, y, bits, fg, bg)`: draw a monochrome sprite.
- `prg32_sprite_draw_16x16(x, y, rgb565)`: draw a 16x16 RGB565 sprite.
- `prg32_sprite_draw_24x24(x, y, rgb565)`: draw a 24x24 RGB565 sprite from
  `24 * 24` contiguous halfwords.
- `prg32_sprite_hitbox(...)`: test two axis-aligned rectangles.
- `prg32_sprite_anim_frame(now_ms, frame_count, frame_ms)`: compute a frame.
- `prg32_sprite_draw_frame(...)`: draw one frame from a sprite sheet.
- `prg32_sprite_draw_indexed(...)`: draw a packed 1/2/4/8-bpp palette frame.
- `prg32_sprite_draw_bitplanes(...)`: draw a planar 1/2/4/8-bpp palette frame.

The 16x16 and 24x24 helpers treat `PRG32_COLOR_WHITE` as transparent. For other
sizes or another transparency key, `prg32_sprite_draw_frame` accepts width,
height, a pointer to contiguous RGB565 frames, the frame index, and a
transparent color. This keeps animated sprites usable from assembly without
requiring a C object.

Compact sprites use `prg32_indexed_sprite_t`, which contains pointers to packed
pixel data and an RGB565 palette plus width, height, frame count, bit depth, and
an optional transparent palette index. They save cartridge RAM and flash for
graphics and animations while decoding directly into the native RGB565 display
path. Existing RGB565 functions and their transparency behavior are unchanged.

The asset converter emits a tagged alias for each descriptor. That alias works
through the existing 16x16, 24x24, arbitrary-frame, and animation entry points;
the animation initializer takes dimensions and frame count from the descriptor,
and the existing animation draw call expands the selected frame. No additional
framebuffer or runtime decompression buffer is allocated.

Every sprite renderer clips once, holds the graphics mutex once, advances
directly across framebuffer rows, and records at most one dirty rectangle.
RGB565 uses a tight transparent-color loop; indexed8 directly loads one index
per pixel; and indexed4 handles an odd leading nibble before translating two
pixels per source-byte load. The 1/2-bpp and bitplane paths retain their compact
generic decoders. Backend helpers preserve the ILI9341 framebuffer's wire byte
order without changing public palette or RGB565 semantics.

See `examples/games/frogger/graphics/game.S` for the assembly call sequence and
`examples/games/frogger/c/game.c` for a fuller game that pairs the 24x24 sprite
with `prg32_sprite_hitbox`.

## Audio

PRG32 has two audio layers.

> [!WARNING]
> **Cartridge Audio Best Practices:** Please don't use the legacy buzzer functions since the physical buzzer is no longer used by default. Just use the new `prg32_audio_note` whenever necessary, the `prg32_audio_note_on` and `_off` if you need to leave something on, the sample functions if you actually need to play a sample, and the track functions if there is a tracker sequence.

The legacy teaching helpers still use PWM to drive a passive buzzer:

- `prg32_buzzer_tone(hz, ms, duty)`: PWM tone with explicit duty cycle (512 is 50%).
- `prg32_audio_note(channel, instrument, note, volume, duration_ms)`: play an asynchronous audio note playing via I2S on a speaker.
- `prg32_audio_notes(channel, instrument, volume, notes, count)`: play a blocking sequence of notes where `notes` is an array of `prg32_midi_note_t`.
- `prg32_buzzer_play_notes(notes, count)`: blocking sequence of notes/rests.
- `prg32_audio_note_on(channel, instrument, note, volume)`: start a PCM or procedural instrument note.
- `prg32_buzzer_sample_u8(samples, count, rate)`: play unsigned 8-bit samples via buzzer
  through PWM.

The I2S audio runtime lives in the `prg32_audio` component and targets
MAX98357A DAC/amplifier boards:

- mono mode: one MAX98357A, default, 22050 Hz, 6 voices
- stereo mode: two MAX98357A boards, optional PRG32 Audio Plus, panned voices
- PCM and SID-like triangle, saw, pulse, and deterministic noise voices
- per-synth-voice ADSR and resonant low-pass filtering

Useful calls:

- `prg32_audio_init(config)`: start the I2S mixer runtime.
- `prg32_audio_get_mode()`: return mono or stereo.
- `prg32_audio_register_sample(...)`: register unsigned 8-bit PCM.
- `prg32_audio_play_sample(sample_id, volume, pitch)`: trigger a sample.
- `prg32_audio_play_sample_pan(sample_id, volume, pitch, pan)`: trigger with pan.
- `prg32_audio_note_on(channel, instrument, note, volume)`: start a PCM or
  procedural instrument note.
- `prg32_audio_note_on_pan(...)`: start a note with a stereo pan override.
- `prg32_audio_note_off(channel)`: stop PCM immediately or release a synth note.
- `prg32_audio_play_track(track_id)`: start tracker event playback.

Pitch `1024` means natural sample speed. Volumes use `0..255`. Pan uses
`-64..+63`; mono mode accepts pan calls but outputs mono.

See [`docs/tools/audio.md`](../tools/audio.md) for wiring, synth-ID encoding,
ADSR/filter behavior, examples, and the cartridge AUDIO block format.

The setup audio menu auto-detects the active output path:

- none
- PWM buzzer
- mono I2S
- stereo I2S

It lets trainers set the test volume, play a short tune, and toggle the
onboard RGB LED as a spectrum-style VU meter when the LED GPIO is available.

## Onboard RGB LED

PRG32 exposes a small addressable RGB LED API:

- `prg32_rgb_led_init(gpio)`: initialize the board LED on a free GPIO.
- `prg32_rgb_led_available()`: return whether the LED is ready.
- `prg32_rgb_led_set(red, green, blue)`: set 8-bit RGB intensity.
- `prg32_rgb_led_off()`: turn the LED off.
- `prg32_rgb_led_vu(level)`: map a 0-255 level to a blue/green/yellow/red
  spectrum color.
- `prg32_audio_led_vu_enable(enabled)`: let the audio test and PWM helpers
  drive the LED as a VU meter.

The reference ILI9341 wiring uses GPIO8 for LCD D/C. Many ESP32-C6 development
boards also use GPIO8 for the onboard RGB LED, so `PRG32_PIN_RGB_LED` defaults
to `-1` in `main/prg32_config.h`. Set it only when the LED pin is free on the
chosen board wiring.

## Development Guide

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This information is only intended for developers of the PRG32 framework.

### General Framework Editing Guidelines

The public ABI is `components/prg32/include/prg32.h`. Keep it small, stable, and
friendly to RISC-V assembly callers.

When editing framework code:

- Keep dependencies in `components/prg32/CMakeLists.txt`.
- Keep `REQUIRES` and `PRIV_REQUIRES` independent of `CONFIG_*` choices; ESP-IDF
  expands component requirements before configuration-dependent source choices.
- Keep app-specific pin and feature config in `main/prg32_config.h`.
- Preserve `prg32_init()` as the one-call framework initializer.
- Do not expose ESP-IDF-only types in the public ABI unless absolutely needed.
