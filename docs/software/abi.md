# PRG32 ABI

PRG32 portable cartridges call framework functions through a stable, versioned
ABI table supplied by the resident firmware. The table is generated from
`prg32/abi/prg32_abi.json`; generated files contain the function indices, ABI hash,
and firmware table population code.

Legacy cartridges can still use firmware-specific absolute imports resolved
from `/api/runtime` or from a firmware ELF, but that mode is tied to one
firmware image. New cartridges should be built with `--portable`.

The public declarations in `components/prg32/include/prg32.h` include the
cartridge-facing contracts for coordinates, lifetimes, return values, and data
layouts. Documentation-only changes to that header do not change ABI indices,
hashes, structure layouts, constants, or generated call stubs. Run
`python3 -m prg32 abi check` after editing it; previously built portable
cartridges must continue to validate and load without recompilation.

Portable C builds use the medium-any code model and disable compiler-generated
switch tables. This keeps normal code, literal references, and explicit switch
dispatch position-relative when QEMU and hardware expose different executable
buffer addresses. Cartridge sources should not store code or string addresses
in initialized writable-data pointer tables; use explicit dispatch until the
reserved relocation fields in the package format are activated.

## Register Convention

PRG32 follows the standard RISC-V calling convention:

| Register | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `a0`-`a7` | arguments and return values |
| `ra` | return address |
| `sp` | 16-byte aligned stack |
| `t0`-`t6` | caller-saved temporaries |
| `s0`-`s11` | callee-saved values |

Assembly examples save `ra` around C calls and keep stack alignment visible.
For portable cartridges, `a0` contains a pointer to `prg32_abi_table_t` when
the runtime enters `init`, `update`, or `draw`. The cartridge-side stubs emitted
by `python3 -m prg32 --portable` store that pointer in `__prg32_abi` and keep
the familiar `call prg32_gfx_clear` style available to examples.

## Stable ABI Table

The firmware exposes one `prg32_abi_table` with magic `PABI`, ABI major/minor,
the generated ABI hash, feature bits, and an indexed function pointer array.
Cartridges declare the ABI hash and required features in the v2 cartridge
header.

Compatibility rules:

- same ABI major and current or explicitly compatible append-only hash: accepted
- missing required feature bits: rejected
- newer incompatible major: rejected
- legacy absolute imports: supported only for firmware-specific workflows

Feature bits currently cover audio, Wi-Fi, multiplayer, metrics, audio-plus,
keyboard, tilemap, platformer, and sprites.

## Cartridge Package ABI

The executable cartridge ABI remains `PRG2` major `1`, minor `1`. Header v2
extends the original header via `header_size` with `abi_hash`,
`required_features`, `optional_features`, relocation placeholders, and
`import_model`. `import_model=abi-table` marks a portable cartridge;
`import_model=legacy-absolute` marks the older firmware-specific path.

ABI minor `1` adds `prg32_sprite_draw_24x24` as an append-only sprite helper.
ABI minor `3` appends `prg32_sprite_draw_indexed` and
`prg32_sprite_draw_bitplanes`. The runtime accepts the prior ABI 1.2 hash so
already-built portable cartridges continue to load; existing function indices
and all RGB565 prototypes remain unchanged.

## Compact Sprite ABI Calls

| Symbol | Asset layout |
|---|---|
| `prg32_sprite_draw_indexed` | packed palette indices, most-significant pixel first in each byte |
| `prg32_sprite_draw_bitplanes` | plane-major bitmaps, least-significant value plane first |

Both calls receive `x`, `y`, a pointer to `prg32_indexed_sprite_t`, and a frame
index. The descriptor points to pixel bytes and an RGB565 palette and records
width, height, frame count, palette count, bits per pixel, and a signed
transparent index.
Supported depths are 1, 2, 4, and 8 bits per pixel. `-1` makes every palette
entry opaque; 8-bit assets may select any transparent index through 255. Each
frame starts on its own byte boundary.

Four-bit packed assets contain two pixels per byte, high nibble first, and at most 16 shared palette
entries. Eight-bit assets contain one pixel per byte and at most 256 shared
entries. One descriptor palette is shared across every animation frame.

Packed frames are frame-major and each frame begins on a byte boundary.
Bitplanes are also frame-major; within a frame the least-significant index
plane comes first. Each plane contains rows in top-to-bottom order. Every row is
independently byte-aligned, pixel 0 occupies bit 7, and unused low bits in the
last byte are zero. This permits the renderer to load one byte from each plane
and reconstruct up to eight adjacent pixels without arbitrary bit addressing.

Generated assets expose a pointer with bit zero tagged as compact (bit one
selects planar layout). Because RGB565 arrays are naturally aligned, the tag is
unambiguous and the signatures and layouts of `prg32_anim_sprite_t` and all
existing sprite functions remain unchanged. Passing the generated tagged alias
through `prg32_sprite_draw_16x16`, `prg32_sprite_draw_24x24`,
`prg32_sprite_draw_frame`, or `prg32_sprite_anim_init` makes the existing draw
and animation paths dispatch indexed data automatically. Untagged pointers use
the original RGB565 path and its unchanged transparent-color comparison.
For tagged calls through an existing RGB565 function, the reconstructed RGB565
palette value is compared with that function's transparent-color argument;
the descriptor's transparent index is also honored. The additive direct compact
calls use the descriptor index because their prototypes contain no color key.

These calls add asset encodings, not a new physical display ABI. Drawing still
targets the existing RGB565 framebuffer, so legacy RGB565 sprite calls,
screenshots, and display backends behave exactly as before.

The row-blitter optimization is entirely internal: it does not change the
public header, structure layouts, function indices, feature bits, or ABI hash.
Already-built portable ABI-table cartridges therefore continue to load and use
the same RGB565 and indexed entry points. Firmware-specific legacy-absolute
cartridges retain their existing limitation: they are compatible only with the
firmware image whose exported addresses were used when they were linked.

Store-ready cartridges append a backward-compatible `PRG32META` trailer after
the payload. The trailer gives host tools and setup-mode clients standard
blocks for `META`, `ICON`, `SCRN`, `SIGN`, and `COLO`.

Please refer to the [Colophon ABI](colophon_abi.md) for full documentation on cartridge metadata and colophon formats.

## Audio ABI Calls

The audio ABI is the C API exposed to cartridges:

| Symbol | Purpose | Return |
|---|---|---|
| `prg32_audio_init` | initialize mono/stereo runtime | `bool` |
| `prg32_audio_shutdown` | stop audio runtime | none |
| `prg32_audio_get_mode` | return `PRG32_AUDIO_MODE_MONO` or `STEREO` | mode |
| `prg32_audio_play_sample` | play sample centered | channel or negative |
| `prg32_audio_play_sample_pan` | play sample with pan | channel or negative |
| `prg32_audio_stop_channel` | stop one voice | none |
| `prg32_audio_stop_all` | stop all voices | none |
| `prg32_audio_note_on` | start PCM or synth instrument note | none |
| `prg32_audio_note_on_pan` | start PCM or synth note with pan | none |
| `prg32_audio_note_off` | stop PCM or begin synth release | none |
| `prg32_audio_play_track` | start tracker stream | none |
| `prg32_audio_stop_track` | stop tracker stream | none |
| `prg32_audio_set_tempo` | set tracker BPM | none |
| `prg32_audio_set_master_volume` | set global volume | none |
| `prg32_audio_set_channel_volume` | set one voice volume | none |
| `prg32_audio_set_channel_pan` | set one voice pan | none |
| `prg32_audio_led_vu_enable` | allow audio helpers to drive the RGB LED VU meter | none |
| `prg32_audio_led_vu_enabled` | read the RGB LED VU meter flag | `int` |
| `prg32_audio_led_vu_level` | update the RGB LED VU level if enabled | none |

Pan uses signed values:

```text
-64 full left, 0 center, +63 full right
```

Mono builds accept pan calls but mix to one output. Stereo-only programs should
check `prg32_audio_get_mode()` before making a wiring assumption.

SID-like synthesis is ABI-neutral: bit 15 of the existing instrument
`sample_id` selects a procedural instrument. No function index, prototype,
descriptor layout, tracker event, or AUDIO block version changed. Portable
cartridges built before synthesis therefore remain compatible, and ordinary
sample IDs retain PCM semantics. The encoding is defined in the
[audio guide](../tools/audio.md#sid-like-procedural-instruments).

## RGB LED ABI Calls

The onboard RGB LED API is optional because many classroom display harnesses use
the same GPIO as the board LED. Check availability before depending on it.

| Symbol | Purpose | Return |
|---|---|---|
| `prg32_rgb_led_init` | initialize an addressable RGB LED on a GPIO | `0` or negative |
| `prg32_rgb_led_available` | report whether the LED is ready | `int` |
| `prg32_rgb_led_set` | set red, green, blue intensity | none |
| `prg32_rgb_led_off` | turn the LED off | none |
| `prg32_rgb_led_vu` | map a 0-255 level to spectrum color | none |

## Error Values

Audio calls that return `int` use a non-negative channel number for success and
a negative value for failure. Common failure causes:

- audio runtime was not initialized
- ordinary PCM sample id is missing
- channel id is outside the configured voice table
- AUDIO block is invalid

## Assembly Example

```asm
    li a0, 0          /* sample id */
    li a1, 255        /* volume */
    li a2, 1024       /* natural pitch */
    call prg32_audio_play_sample
```

For stereo pan:

```asm
    li a0, 0
    li a1, 255
    li a2, 1024
    li a3, -64        /* left */
    call prg32_audio_play_sample_pan
```
