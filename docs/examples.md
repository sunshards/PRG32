# PRG32 Examples

PRG32 examples are split into game examples and focused feature examples.

## Audio Examples

| Example | Purpose | Hardware |
|---|---|---|
| `examples/features/audio_mono_beep` | generated mono tone smoke test | one MAX98357A |
| `examples/features/audio_mono_sample` | unsigned 8-bit PCM sample playback | one MAX98357A |
| `examples/features/audio_mono_tracker` | tracker event sequence | one MAX98357A |
| `examples/features/audio_stereo_pan_test` | verify left/right channel selection | two MAX98357A boards |
| `examples/features/audio_stereo_music` | centered music plus panned effects | two MAX98357A boards |

Run audio examples as temporary firmware apps while validating hardware. For
uploadable cartridges, pack assets with `tools/prg32audio_pack.py` and pass
`--audio-block` to `python3 -m prg32 build`.

## Game Examples

Game examples live under `examples/games`. Each game is organized with ASCII
assembly, graphics assembly, and C sources when available:

```text
examples/games/<name>/
|-- README.md
|-- ascii/game.S
|-- graphics/game.S
`-- c/game.c
```

Use these for Computing Architecture and C Programming classes.

The platformer, raycaster, and wing commander C examples are the fuller
playable companions to the DeviceDemo cartridge pages. The assembly versions
remain compact so students can trace registers, stack frames, and ABI calls
without losing the main idea.

## Feature Examples

Feature demos live under `examples/features` and isolate one framework topic:

- scrolling and parallax
- animated sprites
- dual playfield rendering
- 320x200 game splash screens
- status-band overlays
- tile/platform helpers
- joystick keyboard input
- Wi-Fi setup
- multiplayer snapshots
- audio synthesis
- onboard RGB LED and audio VU meter

The fuller hardware smoke test lives in the external
[DeviceDemo cartridge](https://github.com/riscv-prg32/DeviceDemo). It checks
framework capabilities and includes small 320x200 sketches inspired by Pong,
Breakout, Space Invaders, Pacman, Tetris, Pole Position, and Asteroids, plus a
tile-engine platformer, a Doom-style fixed-point raycaster, and a space-cockpit
sketch that demonstrates dual playfields.
