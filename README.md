PRG32 is an open-source educational runtime for teaching RISC-V assembly and C programming in undergraduate computer architecture and systems courses. PRG32 exposes a minimal interface built around the init/update/draw game loop.

PRG32 provides an entire retro-gaming environment to run native RV32IMAC machine code on the Espressif ESP32-C6, a commercially available microcontroller. The platform includes embedded firmware, a .prg32 cartridge format and toolchain, a QEMU-based desktop emulator and can be used in combination with the Cartridge Store, a server providing app-store-style distribution, multiplayer relay, score tracking, and frame-level metrics collection.

PRG32 is **not** a CPU instruction emulator. Code runs natively on ESP32-C6 hardware, or on Espressif QEMU firmware target ESP32-C3 for desktop graphics/testing.

## Install & Setup

<details>
<summary><strong>Windows</strong></summary>

1. Install Git for Windows and Python 3.
2. Download and run the Espressif ESP-IDF Tools Installer for Windows.
3. Select an ESP-IDF 5.4 or newer release.
4. Include support for `esp32c3` and `esp32c6`.
5. (Optional) Check the QEMU RISC-V emulator box during installation if you want to use the QEMU desktop emulator.
6. Open the "ESP-IDF PowerShell" shortcut created by the installer.
7. Clone the project and verify your setup from that shell:

```powershell
cd $HOME\Documents
git clone https://github.com/riscv-prg32/PRG32
cd PRG32
python -m prg32 doctor
```

#### Notes
- Use the ESP-IDF PowerShell or ESP-IDF Command Prompt, not a plain terminal
where `idf.py` has not been exported.
- If flashing fails, check Device Manager for the ESP32-C6 serial port and pass
  it explicitly with `-p COMx`.
- If PlatformIO Monitor cannot open the port, close Arduino Serial Monitor,
  ESP-IDF Monitor, and every other terminal using the same COM port.

<summary><strong>Linux</strong></summary>

Install dependencies (Debian/Ubuntu):
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y git wget flex bison gperf python3 python3-venv python3-pip cmake ninja-build ccache libffi-dev libssl-dev dfu-util libusb-1.0-0 curl zip
```

Install QEMU native libraries (optional, required for QEMU desktop emulator only):
```bash
sudo apt install -y libgcrypt20 libglib2.0-0 libpixman-1-0 libsdl2-2.0-0 libslirp0
```

Install ESP-IDF:
```bash
cd $HOME
git clone -b v5.4 --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf.git
cd esp-idf
./install.sh esp32c3,esp32c6
. ./export.sh
# Optional: install QEMU desktop emulator
python $IDF_PATH/tools/idf_tools.py install qemu-riscv32
```

Clone the project and verify your setup:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/riscv-prg32/PRG32
cd PRG32
python3 -m prg32 doctor
```

Linux serial permissions:
```bash
sudo usermod -aG dialout "$USER"
```
Log out and back in after changing group membership.

#### Notes
ESP32-C6 boards usually appear as `/dev/ttyACM0`; USB serial adapters may appear as `/dev/ttyUSB0`. If the board is visible but flashing fails, check `dialout` membership and
reconnect the USB cable after logging in again.

<summary><strong>macOS</strong></summary>

Install dependencies:
```bash
brew install git cmake ninja dfu-util ccache libusb python curl zip
```

Install QEMU native libraries (optional, required for QEMU desktop emulator only):
```bash
brew install libgcrypt glib pixman sdl2 libslirp
```

Install ESP-IDF:
```bash
cd $HOME
git clone -b v5.4 --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf.git
cd esp-idf
./install.sh esp32c3,esp32c6
. ./export.sh
# Optional: install QEMU desktop emulator
python $IDF_PATH/tools/idf_tools.py install qemu-riscv32
```

Clone the project and verify your setup:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/riscv-prg32/PRG32
cd PRG32
python3 -m prg32 doctor
```

<summary><strong>PlatformIO (Alternative)</strong></summary>

While ESP-IDF standalone is the primary and recommended way to install and build PRG32, you can also use PlatformIO. Open the repository root in PlatformIO. The checked-in `platformio.ini` default environment targets the ESP32-C6.

**CLI Setup (Linux/macOS):**
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv-platformio
. .venv-platformio/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install platformio
pio run
pio run -t upload
pio device monitor -b 115200
```

**VS Code Setup (Windows):**
1. Install Git for Windows.
2. Install Visual Studio Code.
3. Install the Espressif ESP-IDF extension for VS Code.
4. Install the PlatformIO extension for VS Code.
5. Install the Microsoft C/C++ and Python extensions.

- Use the checked-in `PRG32.code-workspace` for student labs; paths are
  workspace-relative.
  
**CLI Setup (Windows):**
```powershell
cd $HOME\Documents\PRG32
pio run
pio run -t upload
pio device monitor -b 115200
```

The ESP32-C6 build keeps UART0 as the primary ESP-IDF console and enables
native USB Serial/JTAG as a secondary output for PlatformIO Monitor. A healthy
boot logs the configured `prg32_lcd` ILI9341 pins before drawing the splash.

The PlatformIO environment is for the physical ESP32-C6 classroom board. Keep
using the `idf.py` commands in `docs/qemu.md` for QEMU screen builds.
